students to choose an emphasis in either the photography or video fields. The course is for students

who are highly motivated and are interested in pursuing a career in a photography, video, or commu-
nications field. The 15 minute arrival time before school to produce Mustang Vision every morning

and working on weekly live streams of events at South Western High School in the evening hours
are required of all students in this class.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="col align-center">
									
									<h4>Metal Technology 1</h4>
									<p>This course is open to any student with no previous high school metal working experience. Students
enrolled in the course work in areas of foundry, machine shop, welding, and sheet metal. During the
course, students will be involved in producing their own required projects as well as participating
in a mass production project exercise. Costs for the individual projects are covered by the students.
Costs for the mass production project are paid for by the sale of the project. Class also open for NIMS
pre-apprenticeship students. See section on pre-apprenticeship opportunities.</p>
									
								</div>
								<div class="col align-center">
									
									<br><h4>Metal Technology 2</h4>
									<p>TMetal Technology II is a second level class for the student interested in developing advanced skills
in metal working. The class is an individual project based class; customized to where the student
will research, design, and build a project out of metal in the area of his or her choice. The student
should already have an idea of what area or areas in metal working they would like to focus. Very
important that the student and their parents understand the student designed project will be paid

for by the student. A portfolio to include careers, project idea, research, project design, project ma-
terials, project directions, evaluation, and summary of the project experience will be required at

the conclusion of the course along with the project. Class also open for NIMS pre-apprenticeship
students.</p>

									<br><h4>Intro To Engineering Design H</h4>
									<p>Introduction to Engineering Design (IED) is a course that is appropriate for students that are in-
terested in design, engineering or any highly technical career. The major focus of the IED course

is to expose students to a design process, professional communication and collaboration methods,
design ethics, and technical documentation. IED gives students the opportunity to develop skills
in research and analysis, teamwork, technical writing, engineering graphics, and problem solving

through activity-, project-, and problem-based (APPB) learning. Used in combination with a team-
ing approach, APPB-learning challenges students to continually hone their interpersonal skills and

creative abilities while applying math, science, and technical knowledge learned in other courses to
solve engineering design problems and communicate their solutions.

No previous knowledge is assumed, but students should be concurrently enrolled in college prepara-
tory mathematics and science courses in order to facilitate the use and understanding of appropriate

math and science concepts necessary for the successful completion of IED coursework. In addition,

students will use industry standard 3D solid modeling software to facilitate the design and docu-
mentation of their solutions to design problems and challenges. As the course progresses and the

complexity of the design problems increase students will learn more advanced computer modeling
skills as they become more independent in their learning, more professional in their collaboration
and communication, and more experienced in problem solving.
Introduction to Engineering Design is one of two foundation courses in the Project Lead The Way
high school pre-engineering program. The course applies and concurrently develops secondary
level knowledge and skills in mathematics, science, and technology. See www.pltw.org for more</p>
									
								</div>
							<div class="col align-center">
									
								<br><h4>Principles of Engineering H</h4>
								<p>Principles Of Engineering (POE) is a high school-level survey course of engineering. The course

exposes students to the major concepts (see topics listed below) that they will encounter in a post-
secondary engineering course of study and provides the opportunity to investigate engineering and

other highly technical careers. POE also provides students the opportunity to develop skills and
understanding of course concepts through activity-, project-, and problem-based (APPB) learning.
Used in combination with a teaming approach, APPB learning challenges students to continually

hone their interpersonal skills, creative abilities, and problem solving skills based upon engineer-
ing concepts. It also allows students to develop strategies to enable and direct their own learning.

To be successful in POE, students should be concurrently enrolled in college preparatory mathematics
and science. Students will employ engineering and scientific concepts in the solution of engineering
design problems. Students will develop problem-solving skills and apply their knowledge of research
and design to create solutions to various challenges. Students will also learn how to document their
work and communicate their solutions to their peers and members of the professional community.
Principles of Engineering is one of two foundation courses in the Project Lead The Way high school
engineering program. The course applies and concurrently develops secondary level knowledge and
skills in mathematics, science, and technology. See www.pltw.org for more information.</p>
